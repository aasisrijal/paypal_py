Clone the project and cd to the project directory
1.	First signup for PayPal Developer Account and create sandbox account, both personal and business and create a app
2.	Use the created app client id and client secret in paypal for generating token and replace those values in get_token.py
3.	First to create a plan use createPlan() in createPlan.py, one can change the value of the passed variables to describe plan as 		needed 
4.	Use paypal.py or other files to import createPlan() from createPlan.py and create a plan. See a sample in paypal.py
5.	After creating a plan, it needs to be activated. createPlan() return response with the created plan id
6.	Use that plan id to activate using activatePlan.py, see a sample demo in paypal.py
7.	You can check the status of the created plan by using curl or postman for get request to https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/		v1/payments/{plan_id}
8.	The plan status must be 'ACTIVE'
9.	Now we need to create a billing agreement. Use createBillingAgg.py and pass the data as requied(see paypal.py for samples)
10.	After the successful creation of billing agreement, the browser opens and asks to enter paypal user credentials to agree the   	   subscripton plan.
11.	The response from createBillingAgg() from createBillingAgg.py will include a approval_url in links containing a token.
12. This token is needed to execute the billing agreements. Pass this token to executeAgg.py
13.	Look for samples in paypal.py
